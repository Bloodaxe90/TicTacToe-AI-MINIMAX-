<h1 align="center">TicTacToe with MINIMAX</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
This project was the first I made after becoming interested in AI. It is a direct evolution of https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/TicTacToe_FX and, like that project, was also made using
JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
</p>
<p>
  The project uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play TicTacToe against a player.
</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>
Run the main method in the TicTacToeAIApplication class
</p>

<h2>Controls:</h2>

</ul>
