<h1 align="center">TicTacToe with MINIMAX</h1>
<p>
This project was the first I made after becoming interested in AI. It is a direct evolution of https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/TicTacToe_FX and, like that project, was also made using
JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
</p>

<p>
  The project uses the minimax algorithm to play TicTacToe against a player. I have also implemented two instances of the controller class: one with alpha-beta pruning and one without.
